//File is used for most configuration of the web app.
//Anything that is specific to HackED 20XX or HackED Beta 20XX exclusively should probably be here.
//The idea is to have most changes made here so that it is easy to configure the site without having to change every file.
//This should include but not limited to:
//Logo directories (both event logo and sponsor logos), color palette, google map location, events, presentations, etc.

//COLOR PALETTE

//HERO CONFIG

//SPONSOR LOGOS

//SCHEDULE EVENTS

//PRESENTATIONS
